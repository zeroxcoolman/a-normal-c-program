# a-normal-c-program
did i intend in making this? no

# How to build?
`First thing you need is mingw64`
`Also you need gcc`
`if you have gcc but you cant access it in cmd in windows then you have to edit your system environment variables`
`now cd to this directory if you have cloned it`
`now type gcc main.c and enter`
`this should create a a.out or a.exe type of file` 
`type a.out or a.exe and enter`
`Success! This is meant for a beginner so if this is your first gcc program then Congrats!!`
# Nice! You got to the end!
